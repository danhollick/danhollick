### Hi there 👋

I'm dan, a product designer and hobbyist coder currently pushing pixels over at TIDAL.

### 🔭 Current side-projects: 

- #### [juggle](https://juggle.properties/) - a smart, little property management tool. Built with nextjs, apollo client and prisma. Deployed serverlessly with vercel.
- #### [zebra](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/806578669827234193) - a fast, lightweight colour contrast checker for Figma. Built as a teaching exercise. [Tutorial](https://alcohollick.com/writing/figma-plugin-tutorial-1-6/). [Repo](https://github.com/danhollick/zebra).
- #### [The Fucking Weather](https://alcohollick.com/tfw/) - A weather app for people who hate weather apps. Built with Fuse. I no longer maintain this, hence why the iOS version is no longer available. Working on v2.0.

### 📫 How to reach me:
 - #### [My site](https://alcohollick.com/) - Some writing.
 - #### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanHollick) - DMs are always open. Be kind. ❤️
